I am a first-year MS/PhD student in Electrical and Computer
Engineering at University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Milos
Gligoric](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/). I am interested in
applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques
to Software Engineering and better help software engineers. Previouly,
I completed my undergraduate study at [ShenYuan Honors
College](http://hc.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm), Beihang University in June 2019.
